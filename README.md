Early Stunting Risk Detection System — KKN Community Project

I contributed to the development of a lightweight and accessible digital system aimed at assisting in the early detection of stunting risks among infants and young children in rural Indonesia. This tool was created to empower local health workers (posyandu) by providing a simple yet intelligent platform that uses basic input data—such as age, height, weight, and growth history—to generate quick, preliminary assessments for identifying children at risk of malnutrition or growth issues.

This project was implemented during KKN (Kuliah Kerja Nyata), a community service program mandated by Indonesian universities, where students apply academic skills to address real societal needs. We worked directly with a partner village to understand local challenges, including limited digital infrastructure, low access to advanced medical technology, and the need for tools that are intuitive, low-resource, and reliable in offline settings.
